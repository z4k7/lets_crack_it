// Geospatial Indexing

// In MongoDB, geospatial indexing is used to efficiently query and analyze spatial data.
// MongoDB supports two main types of geospatial indexes: 2d indexes and 2d sphere indexes.
// These indexes allow you to perform geospatial queries, such as finding documents near
//  a specific location or within a certain area.

// 2d Index
db.yourCollection.createIndex({locationField:"2d"})
// 2d Sphere Index
db.yourCollection.createIndex({locationField:"2dsphere"})

// Once the index is created, you can use various geospatial operators to query the data.
//  Some common operators include:
// $near: Returns documents near a specified location.
// $geoWithin: Returns documents that are within a specified geometry.
// $geoIntersects: Returns documents that intersect with a specified geometry.
